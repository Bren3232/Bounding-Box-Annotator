# Bounding-Box-Annotator

Get the bounding box (bbox) points for bounding box model training. This stores the bbox points right in
the image names for ease of use when preparing the data for the Nural Network. Can also get circle points. Since
the circle points aren't restricted to top left too bottom right they may be used as key points.
